            My name is hyperpastel (or Vicky). I am a <strike>dog</strike> computer science student from Germany.</br>
            I love knowing, I am curious about a great many things, such as:

            Currently, I use NixOS as my operating system, and I am eagerly exploring it to find out how far it can take me - 
            perhaps there is no end to this journey.
            </br>
            My preferred programming languages are C3, to which I hope to contribute to soon, as well as C, C++ and Rust.

            I also love feeling. Emotions are wonderful, especially love. And by far more than anything else in this entire universe, 
            I love my <a href="/poem">wonderful girlfriend</a>.
